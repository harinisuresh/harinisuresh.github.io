Hi! I'm Harini. I am an incoming assistant professor of computer science at Brown University, starting fall 2024. Currently, I am a postdoc at Cornell, working with [Emma Pierson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~emmapierson/), [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/) and [Karen Levy](https://www.karen-levy.net/).  I did my PhD in computer science at MIT, where I was part of the [Clinical and Applied Machine Learning Group](https://ddig.csail.mit.edu/), the [Visualization Group](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/), and the [Data + Feminism Lab](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu/). 

My research investigates the limits and possibilities of creating ML-based systems that are grounded in societal context, are shaped by diverse viewpoints, and contribute to justice and equity. My work is fundamentally interdisciplinary, drawing from fields that study _societal context_, _people/communities_, and _machine learning/computation_.  I'm influenced by literature in science and technology studies (STS), feminist theory, sociology, education, human-computer interaction (HCI), machine learning (ML) & artificial intelligence (AI), critical computing, and more. Some examples of my past work include [co-designing context-specific datasets and models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533132) to support civil society activists monitoring gender-related violence, or [building systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544548.3581482) that enable people affected by ML systems to probe and evaluate models in terms of semantically-meaningful concepts that are important to their context.  

Previously, I did my undergrad and M.Eng. at MIT as well, working on [ML for healthcare](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v68/suresh17a/suresh17a.pdf). During my PhD, I've spent a couple summers interning at Google Brain, where I worked on [studying biases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03395.pdf) in word embedding models and building interactive [visualizations](https://github.com/PAIR-code/book-viz) of books with sentence embeddings. I also love traveling, reading, creating pottery, [cooking and baking](https://www.instagram.com/thebubblesbakery/), and doing aerial arts.
