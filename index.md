Hi, I'm Harini. I am a postdoc at Cornell, working with [Emma Pierson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~emmapierson/), [Jon Kleinberg](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/) and [Karen Levy](https://www.karen-levy.net/).  I did my PhD in computer science at MIT, where I was part of the [Clinical and Applied Machine Learning Group](https://ddig.csail.mit.edu/), the [Visualization Group](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/), and the [Data + Feminism Lab](https://dataplusfeminism.mit.edu/). 

My research is at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and human-computer interaction (HCI). I'm interested in helping diverse communities and stakeholders shape the developement and use of ML technology.  In my current work, this takes a lot of forms: for example, using participatory methods to [co-design](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3531146.3533132) context-specific datasets and models for counterdata collection, or developing [tools](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MXG1ZgPkByEGoX933y34oswS0x_OaFsJ/view?usp=sharing) and [theory](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3411764.3445088) for communicating the limitations of ML systems to the people who use them and are affected by them.    

Before this, I did my undergrad and M.Eng. at MIT as well, working on [ML for healthcare](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v68/suresh17a/suresh17a.pdf). During my PhD, I've spent a couple summers interning at Google Brain, where I worked on [studying biases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03395.pdf) in word embedding models and building interactive [visualizations](https://github.com/PAIR-code/book-viz) of books with sentence embeddings. I also love traveling, reading, [cooking and baking](https://www.instagram.com/thebubblesbakery/), and doing aerial arts.
